Risk Disclosure The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as
virtual currencies, involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on
any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in
your assets at any given moment. Any currency – virtual or not – may be subject
to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent
risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything
on a market.Bitcoin trading also has special risks not shared with official
currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which
are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as
gold or silver, Bitcoin is a unique and backed by technology and trust. There is
no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of
Bitcoins in a crisis or issue more currency.Instead, Bitcoin is an as-yet
autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide network. Traders put their trust in
a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on
peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.Bitcoin
trading is probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of
confidence. For example,
confidence might collapse in Bitcoin because of unexpected changes imposed by
the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of
superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary
spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the
anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if
hackers or governments can prevent any transactions from settling.Because on
this platform there are derivatives being traded, there is additional counter
party risk. Under extreme market circumstances Deribit could decide to partially
or entirely close winning positions to be able to close loosing positions.
Derivatives settle every day in 24h sessions. If bankruptcies in a session
deplete the insurance fund, any further losses will be covered by profits made
by traders on the platform on a pro rata basis. In such a case a all winning
traders of a session would get taxed a percentage on their earnings to cover for
other traders bankruptcies.Though Deribit is only allowed to take such steps
after the Deribit insurance fund is depleted. The fund was credited by Deribit
with 25BTC. The fund will be used to cover for system losses due to
bankruptcies. The current status of the insurance fund is shown in real-time on
the “Insurance” page accessible on the platform.Due to the nature of
cryptocurrencies, there could occur situations where Deribit takes the step
where contracts will be closed prematurely for platform integrity. Users of the
platform are assumed to understand those risks. An extreme situation could for
example occur during forks and splits of the bitcoin network.There may be
additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.You
should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk
is suitable for buying, selling or trading Bitcoins.
